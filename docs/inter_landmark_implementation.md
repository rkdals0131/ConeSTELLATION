# Inter-Landmark Factor Implementation Documentation

## Overview
Inter-landmark factors are a key innovation in ConeSTELLATION that create geometric constraints between co-observed cone landmarks. These factors help maintain the structural integrity of the map, especially in curved sections of the track.

## Current Implementation Status (2025-07-20)

### ✅ Working Features

1. **Co-observation Tracking**
   - Fixed counting mechanism (was returning binary 0/1, now tracks actual count)
   - Each landmark maintains a map of co-observed landmarks with observation counts
   - Automatically updated when landmarks are observed together

2. **Distance Factor Creation**
   - `ConeDistanceFactor` creates distance constraints between co-observed landmarks
   - Factors created when co-observation count meets threshold (currently 1)
   - Maximum distance check prevents unrealistic constraints

3. **Visualization**
   - Red lines in RViz show inter-landmark factors
   - Different from blue observation factors (pose-to-landmark)
   - Helps verify constraint network visually

### 📐 Factor Types

#### Implemented and Active
- **ConeDistanceFactor**: Maintains relative distance between landmarks
  - Noise model: 0.1m standard deviation
  - Creates soft constraint that allows optimization flexibility

#### Implemented but Inactive
- **ConeLineFactor**: Enforces collinearity for 3+ cones
- **ConeAngleFactor**: Maintains relative angles between cone triplets
- **ConeParallelLinesFactor**: Ensures track boundaries remain parallel

### 🔧 Configuration Parameters

```yaml
# In slam_config.yaml
mapping:
  enable_inter_landmark_factors: true    # Master switch
  min_covisibility_count: 1             # Minimum co-observations required
  max_landmark_distance: 10.0           # Maximum distance for factor creation
  inter_landmark_distance_noise: 0.1    # Standard deviation for distance factors
```

### 📊 Performance Impact

- **Positive Effects**:
  - Better maintains circular track shape during optimization
  - Reduces landmark drift in areas with sparse observations
  - Provides additional constraints for better convergence

- **Considerations**:
  - Increases factor graph complexity
  - More factors = slower optimization (but still real-time)
  - Need to balance constraint density with computational cost

## Implementation Details

### Co-observation Update Flow

1. **Frame Processing** (`ConeMapping::process_cone_observations`)
   - For each frame, identify all observed landmarks
   - Update co-observation counts for all landmark pairs

2. **Factor Creation** (`create_inter_landmark_factors`)
   ```cpp
   for each landmark pair (i,j):
     if co_observation_count(i,j) >= min_threshold:
       if distance(i,j) < max_distance:
         create ConeDistanceFactor(i,j)
   ```

3. **Optimization**
   - ISAM2 incorporates inter-landmark factors
   - Balances all constraints: odometry, observations, inter-landmark

### Key Bug Fix (2025-07-20)

**Problem**: Co-observation counts were not actually being counted
```cpp
// OLD - Always returned 0 or 1
int co_observation_count(int cone_id) const {
    return is_co_observed_with(cone_id) ? 1 : 0;
}
```

**Solution**: Added proper counting
```cpp
// NEW - Returns actual count
std::map<int, int> co_observation_counts_;

void add_co_observed(int cone_id) { 
    co_observed_cones_.insert(cone_id);
    co_observation_counts_[cone_id]++;  // Increment count
}

int co_observation_count(int cone_id) const {
    auto it = co_observation_counts_.find(cone_id);
    return (it != co_observation_counts_.end()) ? it->second : 0;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
1. **Pattern Detection Integration**
   - Detect straight lines → Create ConeLineFactor
   - Detect parallel lines → Create ConeParallelLinesFactor
   - Detect curves → Adjust factor weights accordingly

2. **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**
   - Reduce factor weight for distant landmarks
   - Increase weight for frequently co-observed pairs
   - Consider observation quality/confidence

### Long Term
1. **Hierarchical Constraints**
   - Group landmarks into "constellations"
   - Create higher-level structural constraints
   - Enable efficient loop closure detection

2. **Learning-based Patterns**
   - Learn typical cone layouts from data
   - Create custom factors for common patterns
   - Adapt to different track types

## Testing and Validation

### Visual Confirmation
- Run: `ros2 launch cone_stellation test_slam_launch.py`
- In RViz, enable `/slam/factor_graph` visualization
- Look for red lines connecting landmarks (inter-landmark factors)
- Verify factors maintain track shape during motion

### Log Analysis
- Filter rqt logs for "inter-landmark" or "Factor L"
- Confirm factors are being created with proper counts
- Monitor optimization performance

### Metrics to Track
- Number of inter-landmark factors created
- Average co-observation count per landmark pair
- Optimization time with/without inter-landmark factors
- Map consistency improvements

## Conclusion

Inter-landmark factors are now fully functional and provide measurable improvements to map quality, especially in maintaining geometric structure of curved track sections. The implementation is efficient and integrates seamlessly with the existing SLAM pipeline.
