# ConeSTELLATION Current System Status

## Last Updated: 2025-07-21

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core SLAM Functionality
- **Factor Graph SLAM**: GTSAM-based optimization with ISAM2
- **Cone Landmarks**: Proper landmark management with color classification
- **Data Association**: Nearest neighbor with color constraints
- **Track ID Support**: Utilizing sensor-provided track IDs for robust association
- **Tentative Landmarks**: Observation buffering to prevent false positives

### Inter-Landmark Factors (Key Innovation)
- **Distance Constraints**: Working between co-observed landmarks
- **Co-observation Tracking**: Fixed counting mechanism (was binary, now actual count)
- **Visualization**: Red lines show inter-landmark constraints in RViz
- **Configurable Parameters**: Min co-visibility count, max distance

### System Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Following GLIM's proven architecture
- **Cone-based Odometry**: Estimation from cone observations
- **Drift Correction**: Proper map->odom transform calculation
- **Real-time Performance**: ~10Hz update rate with optimization

### Visualization & Debugging
- **Comprehensive RViz Display**: Landmarks, factors, path, keyframes
- **Multiple Marker Types**: Different colors for different factor types
- **ROS2 Integration**: Full TF tree, standard topics

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Single-threaded**: All processing in main thread
2. **No Loop Closure**: Drift accumulates over long trajectories
3. **Limited Pattern Detection**: Only distance factors, no line/curve detection
4. **External Odometry Not Yet Integrated**: Placeholder for IMU/GPS EKF (100Hz)
5. **Memory Management**: Need keyframe pruning for very long runs (>1 hour)

## 📊 Current Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Update Rate | ~10 Hz | With full optimization |
| Landmarks | 60-80 | Typical test track |
| Factors | 400-500 | After 1 minute |
| Memory Usage | ~200 MB | ISAM2 manages memory efficiently |
| CPU Usage | ~40% | Single core |
