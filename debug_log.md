# ConeSTELLATION Debug Log

## 2025-07-18 - Initial Project Setup
- **Issue**: Starting fresh cone-based SLAM implementation
- **Problem**: Previous cc_slam_sym implementation with SymForce had divergence issues
- **Solution**: Adopting GLIM's proven modular architecture for cone-based SLAM
- **Result**: Created development plan and project structure based on GLIM's design patterns

## 2025-07-18 - Simulation Integration Complete
- **Issue**: Need to integrate existing cc_slam_sym simulation for testing
- **Problem**: Visualization dependencies and import paths needed adjustment
- **Solution**: 
  - Copied simulation scripts from cc_slam_sym to cone_stellation/scripts/
  - Created VisualizationAdapter to replace missing visualization utilities
  - Updated CMakeLists.txt and package.xml for Python support
  - Fixed import paths for standalone execution
- **Result**: Simulation infrastructure ready for use, can run dummy_publisher_node.py

## 2025-07-18 23:15:00 - Visualization Module Creation
- **Issue**: Need visualization utilities for cone_stellation with factor graph support
- **Problem**: Original visualization.py from cc_slam_sym lacks factor graph edge visualization
- **Solution**: Created enhanced visualization module with:
  - FactorGraphVisualizer class for edge rendering
  - Performance optimizations (visibility culling, edge decimation)
  - Batch rendering by edge type and cone color
  - SLAMVisualizationManager for high-level control
- **Result**: New visualization system ready for factor graph SLAM with performance considerations
